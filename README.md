# CentralCatalogModule

This is a Drupal 9 module developed to provide a more user friendly way for the client to edit specific Drupal Taxonomy and Terms. 

This module was designed for a specific use case and will not function out of the box for any Drupal installation. 

This module works by pulling in the specific taxonomies and terms and provides a way to add, edit, and delete both taxonomies and terms. The primary user interface uses simple Jquery and Ajax to send these changes to the PHP Controllers that manage the actual changes. 

While Drupal does provide a way to update Taxonomies and Terms, this particular client wanted something easier to use for their employees.
